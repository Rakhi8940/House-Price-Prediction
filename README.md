# 🏡 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, location, number of rooms, etc. Using historical data, a machine learning model is trained to estimate house prices, which can help home buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Build a machine learning model to predict house prices
- Analyze the features that impact house prices the most
- Train a model and evaluate its performance using various metrics

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is typically a **structured CSV file** with several features related to house attributes. It may contain columns like:

- `LotArea`: Lot size in square feet
- `OverallQual`: Overall material and finish quality (1-10 scale)
- `YearBuilt`: Year the house was built
- `TotalBsmtSF`: Total square footage of basement
- `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area in square feet
- `GarageCars`: Number of cars in the garage
- `GarageArea`: Size of garage in square feet
- `PoolArea`: Pool area in square feet (optional)
- `SalePrice`: The target variable, i.e., the house price

> 📌 Note: Ensure the dataset is placed in a `data/` directory as `train.csv` for proper access during model training.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Load the dataset and perform initial inspection
   - Handle missing values, duplicate rows, and data type conversions
   - Address outliers if necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze distribution of house prices
   - Identify correlations between features and target variable (`SalePrice`)
   - Visualize relationships using scatter plots, box plots, histograms, etc.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Handle categorical variables (e.g., `Neighborhood`, `GarageType`) using encoding techniques (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding)
   - Create additional features if necessary (e.g., age of the house, square footage ratios)

4. **Model Selection**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets
   - Experiment with different machine learning models such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
     - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

5. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Train the model on the training dataset
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like:
     - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
     - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
     - R² (Coefficient of Determination)
   - Fine-tune model parameters using techniques like cross-validation, GridSearchCV, or RandomizedSearchCV

6. **Prediction**
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data
   - Generate predictions for the test set and compare with actual prices

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the model's performance, the following metrics are commonly used:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual prices.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: The average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual prices.
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (house price) that is predictable from the independent variables.
